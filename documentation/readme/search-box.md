# Search Box

Simply add this to a page with a User Directory on it to be able to search through the directory.

This web part uses the [ReactiveX (RxJs)](http://reactivex.io/) library to allow communication between the two web parts.  
Its functions are identical to the built-in search box of User Directory.

## Properties

- **Placeholder text:** Specify the placeholder text that is shown when the search box is empty.
